I keep all the common files in the 'common' directory. In order to build the
Windows version, you must first create copies of these files in the 'windows'
directory using the copy-files.bat script.

Note: the Free42 workspace contains six projects: Free42Binary32,
Free42Binary64, Free42Decimal32, Free42Decimal64, keymap2cpp, and skin2cpp.
Before building Free42Binary and Free42Decimal, you must build keymap2cpp and
skin2cpp and run them; this creates the keymap.cpp and skins.cpp files, which
contain the default keymap and the skins to be compiled into the Free42
executable.

Starting with version 1.5.9, the Windows build of Free42 builds the Intel
Floating-Point library from source. Run build-intel-lib.sh 32 to build the
32-bit library; if successful, this will create a file named
cl111libbid32.lib, containing x86 objects; and/or run build-intel-lib.sh 64 to
build the 64-bit library; if successful, this will create a file named
cl111libbid64.lib, containing x86_64 objects.
