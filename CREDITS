Free42 is (C) 2004-2020 by Thomas Okken, except:

Decimal math: Intel Decimal Floating-Point Math Library 2.0u1.
INTEG: Romberg integration implementation based on code by Hugh Steers.
LU Decomposition and back-substitution code, and Ridders' root-refinement
   algorithm, based on sample code from "Numerical Recipes in C".
Skins designed by, or based on original work of: Erik Ehrling and
   Sébastien Carlier.

The iPhone version's embedded HTTP server uses Minizip 1.01h, a zlib-based zip
creation and extraction package. Minizip is (C) by Gilles Vollant.

Testing: Vini Matangrano, Dave Johnson, Walter Bonin, Andrés Rodriguez,
   Jeff O., Miguel Toro, Les Wright, and many others.

Free42 has benefited tremendously from, and probably wouldn't even exist today
if it weren't for, these excellent pieces of Free Software: PRC-Tools by
D. Jeff Dionne, with multi-segment debugging support by Ton van Overbeek; Peal
by Greg Parker; Vim by Bram Moolenaar; DDD by Dorothea Lütkehaus and Andreas
Zeller; NetPBM by Jef Poskanzer and others; gcc/g++ by Richard Stallman and
others; gdb, binutils, and too many other fine tools to name, by the Free
Software Foundation and its contributors; and the Linux kernel by Linus
Torvalds and others.

Many thanks to all concerned for the help and advice I received from many
contributors to several Usenet newsgroups and various mailing lists.

And of course, kudos to the inspiration for it all, the excellent HP-42S
calculator by Hewlett-Packard.

A big and continuing Thank You to all the many people whose names I did not
record, who have sent me bug reports, words of encouragement, and donations.
