Motif version: activating the Skin menu by clicking on it, as opposed to the
old-Mac-style press-hold-drag-release cycle, often causes a crash.
Could be a Lesstif bug: the Mac build appears immune, and it uses OpenMotif,
while the Linux (FC6) and Cygwin builds crash, and they use Lesstif.
Sounds like some evil interaction with the callback I use to populate the menu;
maybe Lesstif just doesn't like me repopulating the menu in the map callback.

PalmOS: Flag 11 doesn't work on power cycle: After exit and restart, it does
work; after power cycle, the "running" annunciator comes on, but the program
does not actually run. Sounds like the event queue needs to be prodded.

The whole flag 11 thing seems flaky on several platforms.
Also, what about  LBL "NASTY"  SF 11  OFF  GTO "NASTY"  ?
I think we should have some kind of check for the case where the calc does OFF
without ever having handled any kind of user events since power-on; it should
either refuse to power off, or clear flag 11 before powering off, or do some
kind of user interaction to give the user a chance to break this potentially
inescapable cycle.

Add keyboard click option for the Pocket PC version.

Add a feature for importing and exporting variables from and to CSV files.

Make '\' act as R/S even in ALPHA mode. R/S is important, and the backslash is
not, in the HP-42S part of the universe, anyway.
